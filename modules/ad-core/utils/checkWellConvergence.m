function [convergence, values, evaluated, names] = checkWellConvergence(model, problem)
% Compute convergence for wells.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [converged, values] = CNV_MBConvergence(model, problem)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Compute convergence for well equations. Uses the properties
%       model.toleranceWellRate
%       moedl.toleranceWellBHP
%
% REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
%   model      - Subclass of PhysicalModel that contain equations that
%                are of type well and perforations.
%
%   problem    - LinearizedProblem class instance we want to test for
%                convergence.
%
%
% RETURNS:
%   convergence - Boolean indicating if the state used to produce the 
%                 LinearizedProblem has converged.
%                  
%   values      - Residual inf of wells.
%
%   evaluated   - Logical array into problem.equations indicating which
%                 residual equations we have actually checked 
%                 convergence for.
