function schedule = makeScheduleConsistent(schedule, varargin)
%Ensure that a schedule is consistent in terms of well counts/perforations
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   schedule = makeScheduleConsistent(schedule)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   For a given schedule with varying amount of wells and perforated cells
%   per well, this schedule makes the schedule internally consistent so
%   that all wells are defined at each control step. Some wells will be
%   disabled at different points, but they are always present and thus the
%   simulator output will be normalized and easier to work with.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   schedule - Schedule with possibly inconsistent numbers of wells and
%              perforations.
%
% RETURNS:
%   schedule - Equivialent schedule that is consistent in the well and cell
%              numberings.
