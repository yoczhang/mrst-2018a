function s = setupOperatorsTPFA(G, rock, varargin)
% Set up helper structure for solvers based on automatic differentiation.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   s = setupOperatorsTPFA(G, rock)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The automatic differentiation solvers rely on discrete operators for
%   divergence and gradient on the grid as well as a variety of derived
%   reservoir quantities such as transmissibility and pore volume. The
%   purpose of this function is to assemble all such quantities using a
%   standard two-point finite volume approxiation (TPFA).
%
% PARAMETERS:
%
%   G       - MRST grid given as a struct. See grid_structure.m for more
%             details.
%
%   rock    - Rock structure containing fields .perm and .poro with
%             approprioate dimensions for the grid. See makeRock for more
%             details.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%   'deck'      - deck file containing rock properties
%
%   'trans'     - transmissibility for internal faces (if neighbors given) or for all faces (if
%                 neighbors are not given)
%
%   'neighbors' - neighbors for each internal face
%
%   'porv'      - pore volumes for all cells
%
% RETURNS:
%   s        - Operators struct, with discrete operators and derived
%              quantities:
%              T_all - Transmissibilities for all interfaces, *including*
%              (half) transmissibilities for faces on the boundary. One
%              value per interface.
%              T - Transmissibilities for all internal interfaces. Internal
%              interfaces have a cell on both sides.
%              pv - Pore volumes. See function `poreVolume`. One value per
%              cell.
%              C - Transfer matrix between cells and faces. Used to derive
%              discrete gradient and divergence operators.
%              faceAvg  - (Function) For each interface, computes the
%              average value of a quantity defined in the cells. If a face
%              is connecting two cells, the faceAvg function will
%              compute the arithmetic average of the values in both cells.
%
%   Grad     - Discrete gradient as function handle. Computes the gradient
%              on each interface via a first order finite difference
%              approximation using the values of the cells connected to the
%              face. Note that this discrete gradient does *not* divide by
%              the distance between the points.
%
%   Div      - (Function) Discrete divergence. Integrates / sums up
%              values on the interfaces for all cells to give the
%              (integrated) divergence per cell.
%
%   faceUpstr - (Function) Perform upstream weighting of values. Given a
%               set of cell wise values and a upstream flag for each
%               interface, this function will pick the values corresponding
%               to the position in the neighborship. I.e. if the flag is
%               true for a given interface, it will select the value in the
%               FIRST cell connected to the interface x(N(faceNo, 1)).
%               Otherwise, it will select the SECOND x(N(faceNo, 2)).
%               Typical usage is for upstream weighting of transported
%               quantities.
%
%   N         - Neighborship structure. Will be number of interfaces by 2
%               in size where N(ix, :) contains the cells connected to
%               face number ix.
