classdef NonLinearSolver < handle
    %Generalized Newton-like nonlinear solver
    %
    % SYNOPSIS:
    %   solver = NonLinearSolver()
    %
    %   solver = NonLinearSolver('maxIterations', 5)
    %
    % DESCRIPTION:
    %   The NonLinearSolver class is a general non-linear solver based on
    %   Newton's method. It is capable of timestep selection and cutting based
    %   on convergence rates and can be extended via subclassing or modular
    %   linear solvers and timestep classes.
    %
    %   Convergence is handled by the PhysicalModel class. The NonLinearSolver
    %   simply responds based on what the model reports in terms of convergence
    %   to ensure some level of encapsulation.
    %
    % REQUIRED PARAMETERS:
    %   None.
    %
    % RETURNS:
    %   A NonLinearSolver class instance ready for use.

    properties
        maxIterations % The max number of iterations during a ministep.
        minIterations % The minimum number of solves during a ministep.
        maxTimestepCuts  % The maximum number of times the timestep can be halved before it is counted as a failed attempt
        LinearSolver % The solver used to solve the linearized problems during the simulation.
        verbose % Verbose flag used to get extra output during simulation.
        identifier % String identifier for the nonlinear solver
        timeStepSelector % Subclass of SimpleTimeStepSelector used to select timesteps
        % during simulation. By default no dynamic timestepping will be
        % enabled.
        useRelaxation % Boolean indicating if Newton increments should be relaxed.
        relaxationParameter % Relaxation parameter between 0 and 1.
        % This is modified dynamically if useRelaxation is on, and should 
        % in general not be modified unless you know what you are doing.
        % Either 'dampen', 'sor' or 'none'
        % For dampen, where w = relaxationParameter.
        %       x_new = x_old + dx*w
        % For successive over-relaxation (SOR)
        %       x_new = x_old + dx*w + dx_prev*(1-w)
        relaxationType % Relaxation is reduced by this when stagnation occurs
        relaxationIncrement 
        minRelaxation % Lowest possible relaxation factor
        maxRelaxation % Largest possible relaxation factor
        
        useLinesearch % True to enable line-search in residual
        alwaysUseLinesearch % Debug option to always use line search
        linesearchReductionFactor % Reduction factor for each step in LS
        linesearchDecreaseFactor % Required reduction factor in residual (default 1)
        linesearchMaxIterations % Max iterations in linesearch
        linesearchConvergenceNames % Residual names to be checked in linesearch
        linesearchResidualScaling % Residual scaling for each equation
        linesearchReductionFn % Function for combining multiple residuals into value used by linesearch
        convergenceIssues
        enforceResidualDecrease % Abort a solution if no reduction is residual is happening.
        stagnateTol % Stagnation tolerance - used in relaxation to determine of a residual value is no longer decreasing
        errorOnFailure % If error on failure is not enabled, the solver will return even though it did not converge. May be useful for debugging. Results should not be relied upon if this is enabled. If errorOnFailure is disabled, the solver will continue after a failed timestep, treating it as a simply non-converged result with the maximum number of iterations
        continueOnFailure % Continue even if failure is reported by the model. Results are most likely not useful. Intended for nested nonlinear solvers.
