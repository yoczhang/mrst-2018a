function state = updateAdsorption(state0, state, model)
%
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   function state = updateAdsorption(state0, state, model)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%   Update the adsorption value in the state variable. Used by the
%   surfactant models.
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   state0 - State at previous time step
%   state  - State at current time state
%   model  - Instance of the model
%
% RETURNS:
%   state - State at current time state with updated adsorption values.
