function [stable, x, y] = phaseStabilityTest(eos, z, p, T, x, y, varargin)
% Perform a phase stability test for a mixture
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [stable, x, y] = phaseStabilityTest(eos, z, p, T, x, y)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Perform a phase stability test for a multicomponent 
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   eos - EquationOfState derived class instance.
%   z   - Composition as a matrix with number of rows equal to the number
%         of components.
%   p   - Pressures as a column vector
%   T   - Temperatures as a column vector
%   x   - Initial guess for liquid mole fractions as a matrix with number
%         of rows equal to the number of components. For the most general
%         case, this is equal to z.
%   y   - Initial guess for vapor mole fractions as a matrix with number
%         of rows equal to the number of components. For the most general
%         case, this is equal to z.
%
% OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
%
%  'tol_equil'   - Tolerance for equilibrium constants in stability test.
%                  Uses the natural logarithm of K_i squared as a norm.
%
%  'tol_trivial' - Tolerance for the trivial test
%
%  'solve_both'  - Perform a stability test for a second liquid-like phase
%                  for cells already determined to be unstable by the
%                  second vapor-like phase. This has slightly higher
%                  computational cost since the stability must be checked
%                  twice, but the phase fraction estimates are more
%                  accurate. Enabled by default if x, y are requested as
%                  outputs.
%
% RETURNS:
%   stable - Indicator. If the entry for cell i is true, then the mixture
%            is stable (single-phase) for the p, T regime in that cell.
%   x      - Estimates of liquid mole fractions. Equal to z for stable
%            cells.
%   y      - Estimates of vapor mole fractions. Equal to z for stable
%            cells.
