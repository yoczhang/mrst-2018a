The directories correspond to the following research papers:

CAGEO-75/   : Spill Point Analysis and Structural Trapping Capacity in Saline
            Aquifers Using MRST-co2lab

COMG-1/   : Robust Simulation of Sharp-Interface Models for Fast Estimation of
            CO2 Trapping Capacity

COMG-2/   : Fully-Implicit Simulation of Vertical-Equilibrium Models with
            Hysteresis and Capillary Fringe 

CAGEO-79/ : Analysis of CO2 Trapping Capacities and Long-Term Migration for
            Geological Formations in the Norwegian North Sea Using MRST-co2lab (*)


The directories contain MATLAB code that can be used with co2lab to generate the
examples within.  Minor discrepancies may occur as a side effect of later code
maintenance.

In each of the paper directories, there is a Matlab script called
'runAllExamples_paperX'. This script documents the exact calls to other scripts
and functions used to generate the diagrams/graphs of each specific figure in
that paper. The script is thus not intended to be run through from beginning to
end, but to document how each specific figure is generated.

(*) - Some of the scripts for this paper are planned to be made available in a 
      future release.
