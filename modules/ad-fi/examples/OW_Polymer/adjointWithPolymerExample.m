%% 2 phases system with polymer
% In this example, we look at a 2 phases system with polymer. The polymer
% model uses the <http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/3484-PA Todd-Longstaff mixing
% model> and also accounts for dead pore space, adsorption and reduced
% permeability. All these properties are given in the file |poly.inc| which
% follows Eclipse format. Polymer are used to increase the water viscosity
% and establish a more favorable ratio between the oil and water
% mobilities. This example contains a simple $31\times31\times3$ fine grid
% with two injectors in opposite corners and one producer in the middle of
% the domain. All wells are completed in the top layers of cells. We build
% up a polymer plug by first injecting water with polymer (concentration
% $c=c_{max}$ and $c=\frac14c_{max}$ in the first and second injection
% wells, respectively) and, then, water without polymer to maintain the
% pressure gradient in the reservoir.

%% Plot polymer properties
% When polymer is added to the water phase, the viscosity of the water
% phase containing polymer is increased. Because mobility is defined as
% $\lambda_w = \frac{K}{mu_w}$, this makes the water less mobile. Polymer
% is used in cases where the water is much more mobile than the
% hydrocarbons we are trying to displace. The viscosity of the polymer
% solution depends on the polymer concentration. In the fully mixed case
% (mixing parameter $\omega=1$), then the effective water viscosity is
% given by $\mu_{w,eff}(c)=\mu_w\mu_c(c)$ where $\mu_c$ is the viscosity
% multiplier and $\mu_w$ the water viscosity without polymer.

%% Set up systems.
% To quantify the effect of adding the polymer to the injected water, we
% will solve the same system both with and without polymer. This is done by
% creating both a Oil/Water/Polymer system and a Oil/Water system. Note
% that since the data file already contains polymer as an active phase we
% do not need to pass initADISystem anything other than the deck.

systemOW =      initADISystem({'Oil', 'Water'}, G, rock, fluid);

systemOW.activeComponents      %# ok

%% Run the schedule
% Once a system has been created it is trivial to run the schedule. Any
% options such as maximum non-linear iterations and tolerance can be set in
% the system struct.

[wellSolsOW, statesOW] = ...

%% Objective functions
% Create objective functions for the different systems. We set up
% approximate prices in USD for both the oil price and the injection cost
% of the different phases. The polymer injection cost is 0.1 dollar per kg
% injected.

          'WaterProductionCost',   1  , ...
          'WaterInjectionCost',    0.1, ...
          'DiscountFactor',        0.1 };

% We first calculate the NPV of the pure oil/water solution.
objectiveOW = NPVOW(G, wellSolsOW, schedule, prices{:});

% Calculate the objective function for three different polymer prices
objectivePolymer = ...

% 'computePartials' to true.

%% Plot accumulated present value
% In each time step the objective function is now the net present value of
% the reservoir, i.e. the cost of doing that timestep. However, the most
% interesting value is here the accumulated net present value, as it will
% show us the profit for the lifetime of the reservoir. We plot the three
% different polymer cost as well as the total profit without polymer
% injection.
%
% While polymer injection is happening, the value with polymer is lower
% because there is an increased cost due to the polymer price. Once the
% polymer injection phase is over, we reap the benefits and get an
% increased oil output resulting in a bigger total value for the reservoir
% lifetime.
