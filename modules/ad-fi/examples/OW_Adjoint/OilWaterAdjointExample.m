%% Two phases flow simulation using AD and including adjoint computations
% The problem is defined in 'INPUT_NUMGRAD.DATA' which is a simple
% $10\times1\times10$ Cartesian grid with uniform permeability. We simulate
% the evolution of the reservoir for a given schedule and, using the
% adjoint equations, we compute the derivative of a given net present value
% (NPV) function with respect to the control variables.

%% Read the problem from a deckfile
% The problem is defined in 'INPUT_NUMGRAD.DATA' which is a simple
% $10\times1\times10$ Cartesian grid with uniform permeability. We read the
% deck and create the grid, rock and fluid structures from the resulting
% output. This requires the deckformat module.

[wellSols, states] = runScheduleADI(state, G, rock, system, schedule);

%% Create objective functions
% We can then create objective functions, which are here net profit worth.
% Since the adjoint formulation uses one forward run (runScheduleADI) to
% get the values for the objective function and one backward run
% (runAdjointADI) to get the gradients, we create an objective function
% based on the earlier solution. Since we will compare with the more
% computationally intensive numerical gradient, we also define an objective
% function which will be used for approximating the gradient of the
% objective function in a difference scheme. We set up approximate prices
% in USD for both the oil price and the injection cost of the different
% phases.

prices = {'OilPrice',            100  , ...
          'WaterProductionCost',   1  , ...
          'WaterInjectionCost',    0.1, ...

%% Compute derivatives using the adjoint formulation
% We pass in the objective function of the previous run. The objective
% function had a cost equal to one simulation for each timestep. The
% backward simulation requires one simulation per timestep, for a total of
% two simulations per timestep in the schedule to find the gradient. Note
% that the reverse timesteps are much cheaper to compute because only one
% iteration is required per timestep since the system is linear. Because
% the setup in this example is relatively small, we store the states in
% memory and input them as a keyword argument. If the forward simulation
% would be too big to store in full in memory, it can be saved to disk by
% running runScheduleADI with the 'writeOutput' parameter set to true.
% runAdjointADI will then read the files if not supplied with forward
% simulations directly. ('ForwardStates' not supplied or empty)

% times: Once for the baseline value in the actual timestep, and once for
% each of the two wells to compute the derivative of the objective function
% based on that well.
