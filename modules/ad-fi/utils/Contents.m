%   SolveEqsADI.m              - We have been provided a pod basis, use it to reduce equation sets
%   computeNumGrad.m           - Compute numerical gradient w.r.t wells
%   dinterpReg.m               - if reginx{k} == ':' for improved eff seperate this case
%   getConvergence.m           - Compute convergence based on total mass balance (tol_mb) and maximum
%   getRegMap.m                - if nargin < 4 whole domain
%   getResiduals.m             - Store the residuals for debugging and convergence testing.
%   getSimMatrices.m           - half-trans -> trans and reduce to interior
%   getWellStuff.m             - ------------------------------------------
%   handleRegions.m            - also need actnum/G.cells.indexmap
%   initWellSolLocal.m         - Initialize well solution data structure.
