function [B, dB, R, dR, mu, P] = pvdx(tab, p, varargin)
%Interpolate dead oil/dead gas PVT properties.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [B, dB, R, dR, mu, P] = pvdx(tab, p)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%
% RETURNS:
%   B, dB - Volume formation factor (B) and derivative of B with respect to
%           pressure (dB).
%
%   R, dR - Miscibility ratio (R) and derivative of R with respect to
%           pressure (dR) (== 0 for oil/gas with no miscibility).
%
%   mu    - Phase viscosity.
%
%   P     - Predicate for identifying which cells are in a saturated state.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `pvto`, `pvtg`.
