function [B, dB, R, dR, mu, P] = pvcdo(tab, p)
%Evaluate dead oil properties for oil with constant compressibility.
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   [B, dB, R, dR, mu, P] = pvcdo(tab, p)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%
% RETURNS:
%   B, dB - Volume formation factor (B) and derivative of B with respect to
%           pressure (dB).
%
%   R, dR - Miscibility ratio (R) and derivative of R with respect to
%           pressure (dR).  This is a dead oil table so R == dR == 0.
%
%   mu    - Oil viscosity.
%
%   P     - Predicate for identifying which cells are in a saturated state.
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   `pvtg`, `pvto`.
