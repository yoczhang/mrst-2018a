    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    The Reservoir Simulation Toolbox is developed by SINTEF Applied
    Mathematics and is a result of research on the development of new
    (multiscale) computational methodologies. The toolbox consists of
    a comprehensive set of routines and data structures for reading,
    representing, processing, and visualizing unstructured grids, with
    particular emphasis on the corner-point format used within the
    petroleum industry. The first release is geared towards single-
    and two-phase flow and contains a set of mimetic and multiscale
    flow solvers and a few simple transport solvers capable of
    handling general unstructured grids.
