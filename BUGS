             Missing error checking for SPECGRID, DIMENS, COORD

2008-04-30   readGRDECL not working for Norne and Johansen.
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-06-13   rock:
             Why is dimension of porosity and permeability vector equal to
             prod(G.cartDims) and not G.cells.num!?
             [FIXED]

2008-06-24   mobility ratio in saturation solvers is inverted.
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-06-24   number of permeability values == number of active cells?
             See entry for 2008-06-13...

2008-06-24   Gravity not used/implemented/... in assembleMimeticSystem.m
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-06-24   Mobility adjustments for BIV and BIVW really needed [hmn asks]?
             [2009-11-08: No longer pertinent?]

2008-07-02   rock == [] does not work.  Fix tests and examples!
             2008-08-14 -> ISEMPTY(rock) is not supposed to work!
             [2009-11-08: Won't change]

2008-07-02   gravity runs without densities.  Wtf!?  Or...
             [2009-11-08: No longer pertinent?]

2008-07-02   pside with index set (1:1) seem to crash.
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-07-02   check S.constants gravity scaling
             [2009-11-08: No longer pertinent, S.constants is gone]

2008-07-02   bug in gravityColumn. facePressures are not correct. [OK]

2008-07-03   tests/mimetic_mixed_tpf:
             Smthng s wrng? Wrong R-O-N-G WRONG
             [2009-11-08: No longer pertinent]

2008-08-14   Possibly erroneous evaluation of well fluxes in
             multiscale code?  Currently uses divergence of cell flux.

2008-08-21   Boundary conditions are not supported in multiscale code due
             to design of coarse grid structure.  Needs fixing.  Urgently.

2008-09-18   Hack of functions schurComplement{,Symm} to restore Dirichlet
             conditions does not work.  Need to find a solution of some kind.
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-10-31   blackoilUpwBE.m does not implement flux \nabla\cdot(v f/B).
             B is missing!
             [2009-11-08: FIXED]

2008-12-03   Implicit transport solvers fail when dt is very small.
             Tolerance of residual should scale with time step, somehow.

2009-11-06   In readGRDECL function: an empty space after the file name
             under keyword INCLUDE and before the ending quotation mark,
             produces error message.

             [Triage comment [2009-11-08]: Does this really constitute a
              bug?  Input of the form

                        INCLUDE
                           'path/to/filename.ext ' /

              is invalid (at least in our case), because we don't
              support spaces in file names.  We therefore ought to
              detect such input and error out with a more intelligible
              error message.]

2009-11-06   In readGRDECL function: reading EQUALS keyword encounters
             problem, probably when the box index limits (imin-imax,
             jmin-jmax,kmin-kmax) are defaulted(not given).

             [Triage comment [2009-11-08]: We don't really support input
              BOXes yet (and may not for some time still).  We should,
              however, support "EQUALS array value/" with an input box
              corresponding to the entire model.]

2009-11-06   In readGRDECL function: reading EQUIL keyword encounters
             problem, most probably in defining grdecl.EQUIL .

             [Triage comment [2009-11-08]: Missing feature].

2010-09-23   The 'processPartition' function does not handle partitions
             in which any blocks have more than one cell, but no
             internal connections (ref.: Confidential model,
             coarseDims=[15, 30, 50]).

2010-10-07   tet2grid combined with delaunayn produce unusable grids.

2010-10-17   The input readers that open files don't report file names
             in case of FOPEN failure.  This leads to less than fully
             useful error messages.  The functions in question are

                     fns = {...
                       'readBinaryEclipseFile', ...
                       'readBinaryEcliseTimeData', ...
