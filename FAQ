- TUTORIALS 
 
Q:
I get the error
??? Undefined function or variable
when I try to run the tutorials.


A: 
Run 'startup.m' given in the MRST root directory to add all needed
folders to MATLAB's search path. 


Q:
MATLAB crashes with a segmentation fault when I try to run the
tutorials.
 
A: 
Use of OpenGL as renderer when doing plotting can cause MATLAB to
crash with a segmentation fault and error message such as 

'attempt to draw locked object'

So far it has particularly been a problem for users on Mac and it has
to do with the OpenGL driver, see 

http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1200/1201.shtml

A 'solution' is to write 

opengl neverselect

(in the command window or in the top of the file)

which disables OpenGL - and therefore also results in a bit less fancy
plotting (for instance no transparency).

Q:
Can I access the GSmodel.grdecl file used in the Real-Field Model 
in the tutorial on the web?

A: 
The model used in this example is unfortunately not yet publicly
available, but consider the synthetic reservoir model from the SAIGUP
study instead.


- GRIDS/DATA

Q:
I get very strange results when trying to run my simulation model.

A: 
First check that all your variables have the right unit. MRST uses SI
units, so e.g. the permeability should be in m^2 which means that you
need to convert the permeability if it was given in mD. See functions
'convertInputUnits.m' and 'convertFrom.m'.
